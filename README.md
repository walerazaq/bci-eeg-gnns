Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are technologies primarily developed to improve the quality of life of people who have lost the fundamental abilities to interact with their immediate environment. The final goal of BCIs is to help patients have an effective interaction with their environment through external devices, such as computers, assistive appliances, or neural prostheses. BCIs are also used for cognitive rehabilitation.

Speech-related BCIs offer efficient vocal communication methods for operating devices via speech commands decoded from brain signals. Frameworks and methods utilised to create and execute these interactions between the brain and BCIs are called paradigms. The most common speech paradigms are Imagined Speech, Silent Speech, and Inner Speech.

“Inner Speech is defined as the internalized process in which the person thinks in pure meanings, generally associated with an auditory imagery of own inner voice”. This form of cognition doesn't require physical articulation, rendering it advantageous for individuals with restricted motor functions, such as those affected by Aphasia (stroke) or Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Research into the field of BCIs based on inner speech has been ongoing for years. Despite significant efforts, most studies have yet to achieve state-of-the-art results, particularly when dealing with an increasing range of speech classes. For instance, in a recent study by Han Wei Ng and Guan, the average accuracy in recognising four classes of words – up, down, left, and right – was only 31.15%.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer an intelligent approach to understanding the complex structure of the brain, benefiting from the fact that the brain is readily represented as a network (a graph) of elements and their pairwise interconnections.

This study aims to develop a novel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) framework using EEG data from Inner Speech and GNN models to push the current boundaries and potentially advancing the efficacy of BCIs to empower individuals with paralysis or those requiring such assistance.
